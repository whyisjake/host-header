Add a Host-Header to track down hosting partners in helping combat web spam.

## Description ##

This simple plugin that adds a "Host-Header" HTTP header where you can define your webhost. Web partners that scan for compromised websites can notify hosts more effectively to cleanup sites.

This plugin is super overkill. Adding a simple file with the following to your `mu-plugins.php` will have the same effect.

```
// custom-host-header.php
add_filter( 'wp_headers', function( $headers ) {
	$headers['Host-Header'] = 'YOUR HOST NAME HERE';
	return $headers;
} );
```

## Installation ##

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `/host-header/` plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Or, search for the plugin in the plugin repo.
1. There is no step 3.
